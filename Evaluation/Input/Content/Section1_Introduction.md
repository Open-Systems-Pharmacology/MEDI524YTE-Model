MEDI-524-YTE is variant of the humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody MEDI-524 against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The triple YTE mutation introduced into the Fc region led to an increased affinity to FcRn and consequently to an increased plasma half-life ([Dall’Acqua2006](#5-references)). 

The plasma concentration–time profile after intravenous application of a 30 mg/kg dose in cynomolgus monkeys ([Dall’Acqua2006](#5-references)) were used together with pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 5 other compounds to identify unknown parameters during the development of the generic large molecule physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)). 

The herein presented evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for MEDI-524-YTE in cynomolgus monkeys for the PK data used for the development of the generic large molecule model in PK-Sim.

The presented MEDI-524-YTE PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/MEDI524YTE-Model).
